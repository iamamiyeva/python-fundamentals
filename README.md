# python-fundamentals

This repository contains basic Python programs created to practice core programming concepts and algorithm logic.

The focus is on loops, conditionals, variables, and simple mathematical computations.

## Included Programs

### 1. Fibonacci Sequence Generator
- Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number
- Uses iterative logic
- Stores results in a list
- Prints the sequence to the console

Concepts used:
- for loop
- list operations
- variable updates
- conditional statements

---

### 2. Factorial Calculator

Implements factorial calculation using three different approaches:

1. Using Python's built-in `math.factorial()` function  
2. Using a `for` loop  
3. Using a `while` loop  

Concepts used:
- standard library usage
- loop-based computation
- iterative logic
- variable accumulation
